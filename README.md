## Instructions:

*NOTE: to be changed as development continues*

### Front-end:
1. Using the command line, navigate to the `client` directory.
2. Follow the instructions in the README there to start the application (`npm start`).
3. Open `localhost:8000` in a browser to see the application.

### Back-end:
1. Navigate to the `API` directory and follow the README instructions there to run the existing full-stack web application.

These applications should be able to run at the same time. Integration between the two will take place throughout the first phase of the project.
